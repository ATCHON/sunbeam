# 
# Sunbeam configuration file
#
# Defining samples:
#   Samples must be gzipped fastq files.
#   Samples can be either discovered in a directory specified by 'data_fp' and
#   'filename_fmt' OR by manually listing the samples in a file via
#   'samplelist_fp'. If using 'samplelist_fp', the file format is one sample
#   name per line (no file extension or read pair info).
#
# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved through the following rules:
#     1. If the path is absolute, the path is parsed as-is
#     2. If the path is not absolute, the path at 'root' is appended to it
#     3. If the path is not 'output_fp', the path is checked to ensure it exists
#
# Suffixes:
#   Each subsection contains a 'suffix' key that defines the folder under
#   'output_fp' where the results of that section are put.
#
